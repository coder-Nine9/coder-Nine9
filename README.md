## Hi there 👋

I’m Abdelaziz, a computer engineering student and front-end developer.

I enjoy building clean, responsive, and interactive web applications.
When I learn something new, I like to apply it immediately by building real projects.

If an idea comes to my mind, I try to turn it into a working web app 🚀
